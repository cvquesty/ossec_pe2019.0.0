# Puppet Enterprise OSSEC Test Environment
Includes a Puppet Master plus a CentOS and Ubuntu Node for testing.
This will grow as the test scenarios increase.

In the rollup, I have:

CentOS Linux 7<br>
Puppet Master with Puppet Enterprise 2019.0.0<br>
Puppet Agents 1-2, all customized to the following environments:<br>
- CentOS 7<br>
- Ubuntu 16.04<br>

Due to the limited OS Support nature of this project, OSes will only be added
as the Puppet Code supports them.
